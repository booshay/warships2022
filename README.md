punch list:
--Add chat to your app
 
Let users chat with each other without leaving your app.
In-app chat is a great way to increase engagement, but implementing a user- friendly chat feature can be difficult.

Sync your chat messages between millions of users with Firebase Realtime Database.
Seamlessly authenticate with Firebase Authentication, then set up a chat room in the Realtime Database. Messages appear on all your users' devices in realtime. Use Firebase Cloud Messaging to send notifications so that your users get new messages if they're in another app.
